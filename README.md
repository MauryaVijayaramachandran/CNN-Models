#Keras Model
This is a Keras model built using the TensorFlow backend. The model is a convolutional neural network that classifies images into 10 classes.

##Installation
To use this model, you need to have Python and TensorFlow installed. You can install TensorFlow using pip.

You also need to have Keras installed. You can install Keras using pip


##Usage
To use this model, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the data: You can load your own data or use the built-in datasets provided by Keras.

2. Create an instance of the model: You can create an instance of the model by calling the Sequential method of the Keras models module.

3. Compile the model: You need to compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics to use during training.

4. Train the model: You can train the model using the fit method of the model.

5. Evaluate the model: You can evaluate the model using the evaluate method of the model.
